# Nanoleaf_Challenge

Lightbulb coding challenge for Nanoleaf. This is a single page Android app that takes in a few inputs from the users and runs a simulation based on those numbers. 

You have a bucket of i lightbulbs of j different colours, k of each colour.

i = j * k


The program should randomly take out m number of lightbulbs from the bucket and determine the number of unique colours you receive. The inputs i, j, k and m are determined by input fields. Extend the simulation to determine the expected number of unique colours in after running this scenario n number of times (in other words, the average output of n simulations).


Worst case time complexity: `O(n * m)` [`n` is the number of simulations and `m` is the number of lightbulbs to pick]
